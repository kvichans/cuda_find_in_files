Plugin "Find in Files" for CudaText. Gives dialog to search/replace in multiple files.

- Reg. ex. (Python notation, groups are $0...$9)
- Presets.
- Lots of options (much more than in SynWrite).
- Results are shown in editor tab (bottom pane of CudaText not used).
- Can navigate to found lines from result-tab, using commands (in Plugins menu).

Notes:

- Replace-fields are hidden by default, press the Adjust button to show.
- Some opts must be set in user.json, see info after pressing the Help button.
- Files are handled line by line, so can't find/replace multiline matches, with line-end chars.
